xmlstarlet-rpm
==============

Manages packaging [XMLStarlet](http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net) as an RPM.

The module should probably build XMLStarlet from source, but as an expediency all it currently does is copy the packaging from [EPEL](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) and upload it to the repository's GitHub downloads page.

This package is made available from DTO Lab's [third-party packages](http://dtolabs.github.com/third-party-packages) Yum repositories principally as a convenience to [Rerun](http://rerun.github.com/rerun) users who don't want to (or can't) use EPEL directly.
